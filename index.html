         <h2>Snap Coding</h2>
        <p>Snap is a fun, interesting way to learn the basics of coding. I find it very helpful to assist in learning the basics of coding. </p>

         <p>We made this drawing app for a congressional app challenge. We needed to create a working drawing app that also taught some sort of lesson to, preferably, children. We used the coding language snap to create this app. There are multiple hotkeys within the app, that are each set to a certain aspect of the program. P is for pencil, D is for drawshape, Q is for the eraser, and E is to exit the current program.During the coding, we had several developmental problems that we solved through various methods. When creating the Pencil tool, we ran into a problem. The sprite left a trail that was very choppy. So we removed the dot, and everything ran smoothly.  </p>
